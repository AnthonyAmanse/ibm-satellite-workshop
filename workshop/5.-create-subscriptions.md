# 5. Create Subscriptions

Subscriptions allow you to deploy the versions you created.

* Navigate back through the **Overview** tab on the left side bar and click on **Create subscription.** You may need to scroll down to the subscriptions section.

* Create a subscription for your **kafka-mongo-redis** version. Name the subscription **kafka-mongo-redis-on-all-clusters**. Select both cluster groups **example-food-dev-QA** and **example-food-PROD**. This subscription will deploy the version to all the clusters in both groups.

{% hint style="danger" %}
You may want to wait for the kafka, mongo, and redis pods to be **Running** in your clusters. You can verify its deployment by going to the **OpenShift console** of each cluster.
{% endhint %}

* Create another subscription for your **backend-microservices** version. Name the subscription **backend-microservices-on-all-clusters**. Select both cluster groups **dev-and-qa** and **prod**.

For this workshop, you'll be doing the rolling update for our frontend and you'll need to have a separate subscription for each cluster group.

* Create another subscription for your **frontend-v1** version. Name the subscription **frontend-dev-qa-clusters**. Select **ONLY** the **dev-and-qa** cluster group.

* Create another subscription of the **frontend-v1** for the **prod** cluster group. Name the subscription **frontend-prod-clusters.**
