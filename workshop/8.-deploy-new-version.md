# 8. Rollout new Version

* To rollout the new version, you will need to modify the existing subscriptions you created in Step 5. _You can modify it using the UI_ but in this step, it shows you how **you can also use the CLI** to update it

```text
ibmcloud sat subscription update --subscription frontend-dev-qa-clusters --version frontend-v2
```

Here, you're changing the existing subscription that was using `frontend-v1` Version and use the newly created `frontend-v2` Version.

* Now if you go back to the application URL \(you got it from [Step 6. Expose application](6.-expose-application.md)\) of either your **dev** or **qa** cluster, you should see the application has a new theme:

Now, to rollout the new update in your **prod** cluster, you will also update its subscription to use the new version you created in the previous step.

```text
ibmcloud sat subscription update --subscription frontend-prod-clusters --version frontend-v2
```

After a while, the prod cluster should have your new version running! You can verify it by going to the application URL on the prod cluster.

Imagine if you have multiple clusters deployed across multiple cloud platforms or hosts, you can easily deploy your applications to all or just a group of them.
